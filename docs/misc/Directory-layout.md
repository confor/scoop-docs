# Directory layout
Scoop has a specific directory layout which includes installed applications, cache, configuration files and generated shim executables.

The main scoop directory is `C:\Users\user\scoop`, but can be changed before installation with the `SCOOP` environment variable. Global installs are in `C:\ProgramData\scoop`.

See (Persistent data)[../concepts/Persistent-data.md] for more info on the user configuration files which live under these directories.

## Directories
- apps: software
- buckets: git clone
- cache: downloads
- persist: config
- shims: exes
- workspace: ??
